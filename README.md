# C++ Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of basic to intermediate C++ programs written as part of my learning journey. It includes:

- 📌 Fundamental concepts (variables, data types, I/O)
- 🔁 Loops & conditional statements
- 🔣 Functions & recursion
- 🧠 Arrays & pointers
- 🛠️ Mini CLI projects (e.g., number guessing game, simple calculator)
- 🧪 Practice problems for logic building

All code is written for hands-on learning and building a strong foundation in C++ programming.

> Suitable for beginners, students, or anyone revising core C++ concepts.
